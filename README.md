#CI/CD : Continuous integration is a method were software developers can integrate there works, every integration is checked by an automated build to search the error. In Continuous Deployment final product functionalities are delivered using automatic deployment.

#There are mainly four stages of CI/CD pipeline:
  -Source(git push)
  -Build(compile)
  -Testing
  -Deploy(production)
  
 1) In source stage, CI/CD pipeline is trigerred by a code repository. Any changes in the program triggers a notification.
 2) Under build stage merging of source code and its dependencies takes place. It is mainly done to build a runnable instance of software.
 3) Testing stage includes execution of automated tests to validate the correctness of code and the behaviour of the software. This stage bugs from reachinf clients.
 4) Deploy is the last stage were the product goes live. Once the build has successfully passed through all the required test scenarios, it is ready to deployed
